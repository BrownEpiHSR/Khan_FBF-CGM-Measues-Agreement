## Data Documentation
The `data_documentation/` directory contains the following files:
Data_Documentation_CGM-FBG Agreement.xlsx <

## Code
The `code/` directory contains the following programs:
 1. CGM_macro_cohort 2.sas - <A macro that will generate day level and day-interval level CGM dataset for each person 
			in cohort 2>
 2. Fingerstick_macro_cohort 2.sas - <A macro that will create day level and day-interval level fingersticks dataset for           each person	in cohort 2>
 3. Day level analysis_cohort 2.sas - <Conduct day level analysis of CGM and fingerstick data>
 4. Interval level analysis_cohort 2.sas <Conduct interval level analysis of CGM and fingerstick data>
 5. Phi correlations in R_cohort 2.R <Calculate Phi correlations between CGM and FBG in the day and interval level>
 6. Demographics_cohort 2.sas <Obtain demographic statisitics for the cohort>

Programs were run in sequence to produce the study findings.

<The analytic code for Cohort 2 has been made available on GitHub. While the analysis code for Cohort 1 is fundamentally the same, it has not been uploaded due to data privacy policies>
